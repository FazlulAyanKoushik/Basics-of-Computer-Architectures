# Basic of Computer Architecture

##  How OS Load in Computer?
- 1st step ROM loads the Operating System that is stored in the Hard Disk or SSD to the RAM. After OS taking place in RAM, It starts executing in the CPU core.
Once the OS is loaded, it starts managing the hardware resources of the computer.
It manages the CPU, memory, storage, and input/output devices. 
It also controls the execution of programs and prevents unauthorized access to the system.

- There are several memory system in the computer. ROM, RAM, Cache and HDD/SSD. The most important memory system is RAM.
The Closest memory to the CPU is the Register. The Register is the fastest memory in the computer. The Register is inside the CPU core.
2nd Fastest memory is the Cache. The Cache is also inside the CPU core. The Cache is used to store the data that is frequently accessed by the CPU.
The 3rd fastest memory is the RAM and then the Hard Disk or SSD. The Hard Disk or SSD is the slowest memory in the computer.
The CPU cannot access the hard disk or the SSD directly. The CPU can only access the RAM directly. 
The OS needs to be in the RAM so that the CPU can access it and execute it.
